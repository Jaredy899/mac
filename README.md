# Jared's Mac Installs

This script starts with installing ChrisTitusTech's mybash script and adapting it for Mac. It installs Alacritty and Tabby as the main Mac terminal cannot utilize the fonts correctly. I also changed the starship.toml to use the Tokyo Night theme as I feel it works better for a Mac. But CTT's theme also works too if you want to use that. 

## ðŸ’¡ Usage

To get started, open your terminal and run the following command:
```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL jaredcervantes.com/mac)"
```
