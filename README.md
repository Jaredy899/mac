# Jared's Mac Installs

This script starts with installing ChrisTitusTech's mybash script and adapting it for Mac. It installs Alacritty and Tabby as the main Mac terminal cannot utilize the fonts correctly. I also changed the starship.toml to use the Tokyo Night theme as I feel it works better for a Mac. But CTT's theme also works too if you want to use that. 

(I'm still working on how I want to implement the .zshrc file to incorporate much of CTT's .bashrc files but not all of it.)

## ðŸ’¡ Usage

To get started, open your terminal and run the following command:
```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jaredy899/mac/main/myzsh/myzsh.sh)"
```
